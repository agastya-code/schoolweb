            <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">From a hostel for Bahai children established on 1st August 1945 with sixteen children, New Era has grown into a leading international educational institution. It is under the supervision of the New Era School Committee Trust and under the guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha`is of India.It must fill with joy and wonder every well wisher of New Era High School that it has reached an important milestone with the completion of 75 years of constructive contribution to the oneness of humanity via education, at such a crucial time when so many hearts from the far off corners of the world pray together for the entire humanity's wellbeing, healing and protection.Ever since its inception on the 1st of August 1945, the love and selfless sacrifice of numerous radiant souls and the efforts of all the former and current students and staff, have kept the torch aflame with the spirit of service.The wishes and prayers of all the members of the ever widening New Era Family on this historic day infuse fresh vitality into its activities to acquire a deeper meaning and purpose. May the dedicated efforts widen the path leading to many more landmarks for New Era!

New Era High School strives to provide its students knowledge, guidance and skills such that they become a fruitful branch of the tree of humanity. Education process in New Era focuses on knowledge, wisdom, spiritual perception, righteous character and eloquent speech through academic education, spiritual empowerment, physical training and extra curricular activities.


​
The primary, the most urgent requirement of the age is the promotion of education. Since 1945 till date, the New Era family has arisen to rightly train each student such that the child" becomes the essence of essences, the light of lights, the spirit of spirits."

 

In administration of this blessed enterprise I seek unity of thought, consistent action and determination to learn from our dear parents, staff and students.

 

Sincerely,
